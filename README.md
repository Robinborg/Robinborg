Hello, 
My name is Robin.

In 2020 I found out that I loved to code. 

After jumping headfirst into coding, I have started to focus on machine learning and the fundamentals of programming.

I have gone through all the different ways of learning: youtube, tutorials and projects. 

Now I am coding my own projects to truly learn every aspect of programming.

I have a burning desire to become an expert in machine learning.


If you have any questions or general ideas, feel free to contact me on Github.
